I'm in the process of bringing this in line with the latest flipper firmwares. Right now it loads on my flipper, next I need to test its functionality for bugs. Here are the steps I used to upload:
1. Install [ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt) (`pip install --upgrade ufbt`)
2. Install [PulseView](https://www.sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads)
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/ecopsychologer/flipper-logic-analyzer`
4. Change directories into the repo: `cd flipper-logic-analyzer`
5. Run the app `ufbt launch APPID=logic_analyzer`
6. Launch PulseView and connect to channels C0, C1, C3, B2, B3, A4, A6, A7  
   Try to start pulseview from the terminal
   if you encounter problems with the configuration pulseview via gui

       pulseview -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyACM1

#### continued instructions from the original developer:
Then start PulseView and add a new "Openbench Logic Sniffer (ols)" and select the second flipper serial port.

When arming, you can now look at the trace in PulseView.

Changes:
 - all 8 channels supported Channel 0 is C0, Channel 1 is C1, ... Channel 7 is A7
 - fixed sampling rate not supported (yet?)
 - if a trigger level is defined, no matter which one, the signals are captured as soon this signal changes
 - maximum capture rate unclear. didn't make any tests. guess in the 100kHz range
 - sample count capped to 16384 for now. didn't check what is possible using malloc()
 - only ONE SHOT currently supported. unknown reason. you have to close and reopen the capture window in PulseView (probably bug in PulseView?)
